# BBH-population-kicks
The final project for Astr8020 for Kyle and Levi

# Research question

Given that we know black hole mergers can often lead to a velocity 'kick' after the merger, we want to know how important this effect is when it comes 
to a heirarchy of mergers. Specifically we want to know what happens to the population of black holes after subsequent mergers inside a globular 
cluster, a common place for black holes to form and grow.


## Research plan

To do this, we plan to interact populations of black holes with each other in subsequent mergers. Using a distribution of Masses, spins, and 
velocities, we will be able to semi-randomly interact black holes with each other using the SurfinBH python package, which will give us information 
about the resulting kick velocities, masses, and spins. This will be our second generation of black holes. Any black holes that leave the globular 
cluster will be recorded, but not interacted again. Each new generation will need to time evolve, using dynamical friction to slow velocities, we will 
re-interact these second generation black holes to make a third generation. Repeating this until we have some resulting population of intermediate mass 
black holes (i.e. 500 M_sun). 


Once we have many generations of black holes, we can bring the population densities together to get a total BBH population.


To tie this back to LIGO, we can use the rates of BBH mergers as a way to change our percentage densities into physical densities.
